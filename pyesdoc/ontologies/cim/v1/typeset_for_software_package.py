    A SofwareComponent is an abstract component from which all other components derive. It represents an element that takes input data and generates output data. A SoftwareCompnent can include nested "child" components. Every component can have "componentProperties" which describe the scientific properties that a component simulates (for example, temperature, pressure, etc.) and the numerical properties that influence how a component performs its simulation (for example, the force of gravity). A SoftwareComponent can also have a Deployment, which describes how software is deployed onto computing resources. And a SoftwareComponent can have a composition, which describes how ComponentProperties are coupled together either to/from other SoftwareComponents or external data files. The properties specified by a component's composition must be owned by that component or a child of that component; child components cannot couple together their parents' properties.
