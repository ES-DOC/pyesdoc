For all but the simplest grid tiles, it is envisaged that method 4 above will be the most frequently used option. However, it should be remembered that the CIM is primarily concerned with encoding climate model metadata. Specifying the coordinates of individual grid tiles and cells will most likely not be required as part of such metadata descriptions.
