The hasConstantOffset attribute may be used to indicate that the coordinate list consists of values with constant offset (spacing).

    The GridTile class is used to model an individual grid tile contained within a grid mosaic. A GridTile consists of an array of grid cells which may be defined in one of four ways: 1) for simple grids, by use of the SimpleGridGeometry data type; 2) by defining an array of GridCell objects; 3) by specifying an array of references to externally defined GridCell objects; or 4) by specifying a URI to a remote data file containing the grid cell definitions.  For all but the simplest grid tiles, it is envisaged that method 4 above will be the most frequently used option. However, it should be remembered that the CIM is primarily concerned with encoding climate model metadata. Specifying the coordinates of individual grid tiles and cells will most likely not be required as part of such metadata descriptions.  A GridTile object is associated with a geodetic or projected CRS via the horizontalCRS property, and with a vertical CRS via the verticalCRS property.
